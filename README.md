## 📋 Overview
This project uses an IoT system to monitor ammonia levels in public restrooms in real-time using the MQ-135 sensor. It aims to improve restroom cleanliness and user experience by providing timely notifications to cleaning staff.

## 🛠️ Problem Statement
Public restrooms often have cleanliness issues due to the inability to monitor odor in real-time, resulting in an unpleasant user experience and difficulty for cleaning staff to prioritize tasks.

## 🔍 Scope
1. **🧪 Gas Detection:** Focus on ammonia (NH3) using MQ-135.
2. **📍 Monitoring Area:** Public restrooms in malls, stations, large offices.
3. **🚨 Ammonia Threshold:** 25 ppm as the indicator for cleaning.
4. **📡 IoT Infrastructure:** ESP32 microcontroller with Wi-Fi.
5. **📱 Notifications:** Via Telegram.
6. **⏱️ Monitoring Frequency:** Real-time, data collected every minute.
7. **👥 System Users:** Cleaning staff only.

## 💡 Solution
- **🔧 Sensor Setup:** MQ-135 sensors detect ammonia in restrooms.
- **💻 Microcontroller:** ESP32 reads sensor data and sends it to the cloud.
- **☁️ IoT Platform:** Data stored and analyzed, triggers notifications via Telegram when ammonia exceeds the threshold.
- **✔️ Testing:** System tested and calibrated for accuracy.

## 🌟 Key Features
1. **🔍 Specific Detection:** Accurate ammonia monitoring with MQ-135.
2. **🌐 IoT Connectivity:** Real-time data and analysis.
3. **🔔 Automatic Notifications:** Alerts cleaning staff automatically.
4. **⚙️ Efficiency:** Improves restroom cleanliness management.
5. **💚 Health and Comfort:** Ensures a cleaner environment for users.
